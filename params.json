VERY EASY TO USE.\r\n- Detect new version from App Store automatically. No server-side required.\r\n- Notify user after finish using the app. No Bother.\r\n- Post a notification when finding a new version. You can observe it and notify users in the way you prefer, a UIAlertView for example.\r\n\r\n## Demo \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/lightory/Pigeon/raw/master/Screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Quick Example\r\n\r\n``` objective-c\r\n@implementation AppDelegate\r\n\r\n- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions\r\n{\r\n    [[Pigeon sharedInstance] enableLocalNotification];\r\n    [[Pigeon sharedInstance] startWithAppleId:@\"584296227\"];\r\n    \r\n    return YES;\r\n}\r\n\r\n- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification\r\n{\r\n    [[Pigeon sharedInstance] openInAppStore];\r\n}\r\n\r\n@end\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Customize\r\n\r\nYou can also customize Pigeon as you wish. REMEMBER to set the customizable properties before you call `startWithAppleId:`;\r\n\r\nManage the `latestVersion` yourself, so `Pigeon` won't fetch it from App Store.\r\n\r\n``` objective-c\r\n@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *latestVersion;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe message of local notification.\r\n\r\n``` objective-c\r\n@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *updateMessage;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe country code ( @\"us\", @\"ru\" for example ). You should set this code, if your application is not available in all countries. \r\n\r\n``` objective-c\r\n@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *countyCode;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe notify interval. Default values is one day.\r\n\r\n``` objective-c\r\n@property (assign, nonatomic) NSTimeInterval notifyInterval;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## One More Thing\r\n\r\n`Pigeon` will post a notification when finding a new version. You can observe it and notify users in the way you prefer, a UIAlertView for example.\r\n\r\n``` objective-c\r\n[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(showNewVersionAlertView) name:PigeonDidFindNewVersionNotification object:nil];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Who use Pigeon?\r\n\r\nIf you're building your applications using `Pigeon`, please let me know!
